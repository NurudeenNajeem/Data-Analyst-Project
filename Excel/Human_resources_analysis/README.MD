# INTRODUCTION
As part of my Microsoft learn bootcamp, I used python and excel to analyst project on a Human resources data. The dataset contain about 22214 employees details. The legal team has offices in several locations.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To determine most common work location, state, department, race, hiring age and the common race of the employee in the dataset.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS

* What is average age of the employee?
* What is average age of the employee?

* Which state has the highest number of employee in the dataset?

* What is most preferred employee work location?

* What is most common race of the employee?
* Which gender common in department?
* Which department has the highest number of employee in the dataset?

# DATA EXPLORATION & VALIDATION#

I explored the dataset with python and excel to get a complete overview of the dataset and access the quality issues needed for cleaning. This is imperative because the quality of this analysis hinges on the integrity and validity of our data.
The dataset contains  22214 rows  and 13 columns for each claim. The column's descriptions are highlighted below, with what is expected to validate each column.
I need to check for missing values and spelling errors in each column.  I remove the blank in the dataset
We have 3 unique values in the gender column: Male, female and non-conforming.
We have two locations i.e. those that are working remotely and headquarters. The location column has no missing values.
The state column has 7 distinct state locations.
The race column has 7 distinct race.
The age column has the minimum and maximum numbers are 21 and 58 and all values are non-negative.
The department column has 13 distinct values.
I explore the data more by calculating the ages and hiring age of the employee


#DATA MANIPULATION#
I explore the data more by calculating the ages and hiring age of the employee
Age column was calculated by subtracting the birthdate from today’s date.
Hiring age was calculated by subtracting the birth’s date from hiring date.

# OBSERVATION#

* White race is the most common race.
* The most common gender is male.
* Most of the employees are working in the headquarters
* Engineering department has the most highest number of employees
* Ohio State has the most highest number of employees.
* Accounting department has the least number of employees.
* A lot of employees in the Ohio State are working both in headquarters and remotely but the remain state are working remotely.
* The average age of the employees is 26 years.
* There is astronomical increase in employees from year 2000 to 2001 and a steady increase in the rest of the year and drop steadily from 2018 to 2020.

# RECOMMENDATION

* Most of the departments has a shortage of females employees.
* We need to give more rooms for the remote work.
* We need to employ more females to work across the state and department.
* We need to improve the standard of living of the workers so that they will not focus to work in Ohio state only.
